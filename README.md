# ZIB, AN ENGINE

08/14/24 : I'm pretty rusty w c++, but I'm getting a handle on how classes/structs work again, & using referencing instead of pointers. Right now I'm using instace functions to modify the vector itself, and static functions to produce new vectors. I think this will be a solid way to keep these distinct, and ensure no state is ever modified on accident while programming. We'll see as I go on if this makes sense as a design principle, or if I find some struct where this makes no sense.
